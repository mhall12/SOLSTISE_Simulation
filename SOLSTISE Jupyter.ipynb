    "# **SOLSTISE Simulation Code Introduction**\n",
    "Written for your enjoyment by Matt Hall (mhall12@alumni.nd.edu).\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLSTISE is a gas jet target for use inside the SOLARIS magnet at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams. This code will simulate the reaction kinematics and track the particles as they orbit in the magnetic field before they get detected. The reaction products will not be detected if they hit the gas jet infrastructure. This shadowing of the particles can then be assessed using various plots at the end of the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general structure of this Jupyter notebook is as follows:\n",
    "1. An event file will be created using the Event_Builder.py code.\n",
    "2. The jet infrastructure geometry (nozzle, receiver cone, gas return pipe) will then be set.\n",
    "3. The shadowing simulation will be run, which propogates the particles through the magnetic field. \n",
    "4. Plots showing the shadowing and reaction products can be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If this is your first time running the code, some directories will be made to contain the different files used in the simulation code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If a solid target has been chosen, the geometry section can be skipped (though, the cells still need to be run).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Event Builder, which is called in the background and not shown in the code below, the user must supply the reaction of interest (e.g. d(28Si,p)), the beam energy in MeV or MeV/u, and the direction that the particles will be detected in (upstream or downstream). Then, the user must either specify the specific energy levels to be populated, or enter 0 to simulate all energies for the levels up to a limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "If specific energy levels were specified, the user has two further options. They can either choose to use artificial smearing of the energies and angles of the reaction products or take a more realistic approach and calculate the energy loss and straggling in either a solid (CH$_2$ or CD$_2$) or gas jet target (H, He, etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "If the all energies option was used, no energy loss is assumed. This option should be used when the user wants to make contour plots of the reaction product shadowing at the end of the code. In general, I like to generate both an all energies event file, as well as a file with the individual levels specified. In Plotter, both of these files can be opened simultaneously and the file with the individual levels can be plotted on top of the contours.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's run the Event Builder or open a pre-made event file: \n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: The user can just press \"Enter\" on the questions asking about the magnetic field, etc to use default values."

    "Now that the pipe and nozzle have been defined, the final piece of the puzzle is defining the receiver cone. This step is a little more complicated and takes some effort outside the code. Since we want to allow for different cone shapes, we need to come up with a way to correlate the y-position and the radius of the receiver cone. When done this way, we can simply take the y-position of the reaction product, calculate the position in the x-z plane, and determine whether or not the particle is inside the radius of the cone.\n",
